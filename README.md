This repository contains the implementation of ideas presented in the paper "Post Quantum Lightweight OWF Candidates Based on Theoretically Secure Primitives: Xors, Error Detection Codes, Permutations, Polynomials, Interaction, and Nesting" by Paweł Cyprys, Shlomi Dolev, and Oded Margalit. The paper proposes various one-way function (OWF) candidates leveraging information-theoretically secure primitives like XORs, error detection codes, permutations, and secret sharing, designed to be secure against quantum attacks.
